# Project: Build the charity: water Landing Page
Transformed Canva mockup into a fully functional landing page using HTML and CSS. Made my concept — brand visuals, messaging, and imagery — and made it real.

This is just a focus on structuring content, applying charity:water brand style, and creating a polished final product that reflects its vision. The landing page is a live, interactive page deployed to the web.
